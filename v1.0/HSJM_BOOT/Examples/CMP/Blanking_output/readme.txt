  This example is based on the GD32A503V-EVAL-V1.1 board, it shows how to configure the
comparator blank function. Configure Timer1_CH1 as the blank source, PA3 as the
non-inverting input pin of CMP, and PF2 as the output pin.
  In this demo,Timer1_CH0(PE6) generates a PWM signal with a 50% duty cycle, connect 
PE6 and PA3 as CMP inputs. Blank source Timer1_CH1 generates a PWM signal with
a 5% duty cycle, use oscilloscope to observe CMP input pin and output pin at the same
time, the output signal is low level at the beginning.

  Connect PE6 to PA3.
