  This demo is based on the GD32A503V-EVAL-V1.1 board, it shows how to configure the 
CAN1 peripheral to send CAN frames, and CAN0 peripheral to receive CAN frames in normal mode.

  When WAKEUP button is pressed, CAN1 sends a message to CAN0, when CAN0 receives correctly 
this message,the receive data will be printed and LED2 toggles one time. 

  User must connect L pin to L pin, and H pin to H pin of JP39 and JP41 on the board for sending and 
receiving frames.
